### Cherry Hill in Central Park ###

We selected Cherry Hill for its central location with a good view of several locations for communal activity, such as the lake, ramble and fountain. The pictures on Google Maps suggests that it attracts a lot of people.

### History of Cherry Hill ###

From the [Central Park Conservancy site](http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/cherry-hill.html), Cherry Hill was meant to be a place for people with horses to water them at the fountain, located at the turnaround. It is so named due to the cherry trees around the hill.

### First Visit to Cherry Hill ###

We sat on the benches on the perimeter of the gravel circus, and observed the ongoings of the area, then walked one round along the circular pedestrial walkway. We noted several points of interest.

Using the park benches as a starting point, how can people collaborate with each other across space, but within sight?

Similar starting point, but without technology.

Using added park furniture on the lawn overlooking the lake, how can we create spaces for people to interact?

How can we bring attention to the historical artifact that is the fountain? How can we show that it unites both past and present?
