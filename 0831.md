### Cherry Hill in Central Park ###

We selected Cherry Hill for its central location with a good view of several locations for communal activity, such as the lake, ramble and fountain. The pictures on Google Maps suggests that it attracts a lot of people.

### History of Cherry Hill ###

From the [Central Park Conservancy site](http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/cherry-hill.html), Cherry Hill was meant to be a place for people with horses to water them at the fountain, located at the turnaround. It is so named due to the cherry trees around the hill.

### First Visit to Cherry Hill ###

We sat on the benches on the perimeter of the gravel circus, and observed the ongoings of the area, then walked one round along the circular pedestrial walkway. We noted several points of interest.
