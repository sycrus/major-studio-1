### 7 in 7: Day 3 - Accessible Puzzles ###

#### Focus Today ####
I am interested in exploring two concepts: discovery, and making math accessible to the senses. 

#### Inspiration: Serendipity ####
On Thursday's lecture, Lance Weiler, whom I mentioned in my presentation as an inspiration for my design values, explicitly mentioned designing for micro experiences and giving time and space for audiences to make serendipitous discoveries. In the immersive experiences that he shared, he provided  aesthetics such as props and set design, that clued the audiences in on the possible interactions available for each scene. The serendipity happens when the audience explores these aesthetics and comes across something unexpected.

#### Inspiration: Accessible Math through Aesthetics ####
I recall spending many a recess reading Martin Gardner's books on mathematical puzzles. While they weren't obviously mathematical at first glance, through the course of solving them, I discovered certain tips and tricks that were actually mathematical thinking at play. I must admit that I was never terribly good at solving puzzles, but somehow, because of the way Gardner presented these puzzles, they were easy to get my hands on, and I could just dive right in.

Gardner remarked in an [interview with the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2014/oct/21/martin-gardner-mathematical-puzzles-birthday) <br>
> “A puzzle in a sense models what all scientists are doing ... they are trying to solve puzzles about the nature of the universe.” 

> Puzzles both provoke creative thinking and are a starting point for interesting research.

> “Puzzles can lead you into almost every branch of mathematics,” he added.

I thought this was very powerful and decided to dive deeper into some elements that are prevalent in his puzzles, and prototype the interactions.

#### Questions to Answer ####
I'm curious as to how using light can recreate geometries like those above, and what sort of user interactions are possible to create these patterns.

#### The Idea ####
I'm trying not to use simulated methods involving code. Rather I am curious about how to use strong sources of light to get rays to get light patterns.

#### Process ####
I first tried out using copper tape on my phone's LED light source, since the blockage of lights would be more complete. I tried poking a hole through but the light is unfocused. I tried cutting a slit once using a pair of scissors, and it created a sort of diffraction pattern, which wasn't what I wanted, though interesting to try this for myself.

I researched on how to focus light, and found out that no amount of optics can create a fine ray, and the only way to do that is using lasers, essentially using electromagnetic waves of the same frequency.

Since I wanted to experiment with rays dispersing from a point, I needed some way to split it. I found that diffraction gratings do this, and that I can test this out using CDs.

The order for laser diodes are being delivered and I will update once I get them.
