### 7 in 7: Day 3 - Accessible Puzzles ###

#### Focus Today ####
I am interested in exploring two concepts: discovery, and making math accessible to the senses. 

#### Inspiration: Serendipity ####
On Thursday's lecture, Lance Weiler, whom I mentioned in my presentation as an inspiration for my design values, explicitly mentioned designing for micro experiences and giving time and space for audiences to make serendipitous discoveries. In the immersive experiences that he shared, he provided  aesthetics such as props and set design, that clued the audiences in on the possible interactions available for each scene. The serendipity happens when the audience explores these aesthetics and comes across something unexpected.

#### Inspiration: Accessible Math through Aesthetics ####
I recall spending many a recess reading Martin Gardner's books on mathematical puzzles. While they weren't obviously mathematical at first glance, through the course of solving them, I discovered certain tips and tricks that were actually mathematical thinking at play. I must admit that I was never terribly good at solving puzzles, but somehow, because of the way Gardner presented these puzzles, they were easy to get my hands on, and I could just dive right in.

Gardner remarked in an [interview with the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2014/oct/21/martin-gardner-mathematical-puzzles-birthday) <br>
> “A puzzle in a sense models what all scientists are doing ... they are trying to solve puzzles about the nature of the universe.” 

> Puzzles both provoke creative thinking and are a starting point for interesting research.

> “Puzzles can lead you into almost every branch of mathematics,” he added.

I thought this was very powerful and decided to dive deeper into some elements that are prevalent in his puzzles, and prototype the interactions.

##### Storytelling and Context #####

Gardner uses simple storytelling and conversations to show possible ways of approaching the problem. Context is provided that makes the problem a possibility in our every day lives, which also encourages us to be curious to look for interesting problems such as these. <br>

##### Replication and Embodiment #####

Gardner presents problems in ways that can be easily replicated by the reader. He understood that in order to make problems and solutions relatable, they must be exist outside the context of the pages of the book, and into the real world. By inviting the reader to try the problems out for themselves, be it through acting or iterations by pen and paper, the reader is able to better conceptualize the problems at hand, and deriving patterns on their own. 

##### Storytelling and Context #####

In the book "Entertaining Mathematical Puzzles", he provides eloquent descriptions of different areas of mathematics. He uses descriptive but simple prose, and frequently uses the words "imagine" and "suppose".

##### Reframing #####

He has a number of lateral thinking puzzles. In the abovementioned book, he labels them as "tricky" puzzles, encouraging users to approach problems that they think they know the answers to, challenging assumptions and deriving deeper understanding.

##### Summary of insights and Reposition of my Goals #####
Gardner's goal seems to be to make recreational math accessible to as many people as possible. Through storytelling he supplies context; through embodiment he encourages iteration; through reframing he prompts prediction and evaluation.

Similar to the exhibits at Museum of Math, his puzzles' primary targets are the uninitiated, and assumes little or no prior knowledge. At MoMath, however, the explanations are separated according to levels of complexity

 This is a goal that resonates with me and also something that I have strove to do in previous teaching and storytelling projects. I am a fan of Easter Eggs, which are essentially rewards for curiosity.

As such, I wish to define my target audience as new learners to the topics at hand,
