I have been fascinated by emergent behavior resulting in beautiful patterns for some time now. I started back as an undergrad looking at Islamic geometric art and recall attempting to trace the  methods of the old masters. Fractral geometry has been such a naturally recurring phenomenon that it has a spiritual status and can be seen on many spirituality websites.

Last night, I revisited this topic of interesting geometries, starting from more fractals (recursive geometry), to sandpile visualizations (cellular automata) to Petrie polygon projections (projection geometry).
