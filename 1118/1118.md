### Aesthetic Prototype ###

My slides on Aesthetic Prototype are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nQwSmDxvm0Lf8SRkZtxGwoW-2WrtzkRWx0wgWbjpaJQ/edit#slide=id.g6b21f92ed5_0_127).

#### Colors ####
Looking at all my precedents on visualizations of wave motion (standing wave generators), vibration (Chladni Plates), osciloscopes, I noticed that they tend to have a glow to them, largely due to technology used, or for better contrast. I am inspired to use this contrast along with brighter neon colors, or UV blacklight. I am also inspired by immersive spaces which create a unique, otherworldly feel which frees the participant to experiment and expplore. Examples of this include the Avatar ride in Disney World, and Tron set design.

#### Shapes ####
Similar to the sketches in my Functional Prototypes, I strive for a simple aesthetic that instead focuses on the subject matter at hand. Simple but aesthetically relevant shapes like circles for the circular notation based beat machine; rectangular but proportionate pieces of wood for the marble dropping music maker.
